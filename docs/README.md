## OctoAcme Project Management Process — Summary

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on several core principles and practices designed to deliver maximum value efficiently:

- **Customer-first**: Delivering maximum value to our customers drives every project decision. We prioritize customer value and usability in all our work.

- **Iterative Delivery**: Work is broken into incremental, testable, and deployable segments to maximize learning and adaptability. This allows us to deliver small, testable increments that provide value quickly.

- **Roles and Accountability**: Each project is led by a dedicated Project Manager who coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications. Projects are guided by a Product Manager for vision and prioritization clarity. Development teams focus on implementation and quality assurance.

- **Data-Informed Decisions**: Decisions are continuously improved through metrics, feedback, test results, and data analysis. We measure impact and iterate based on evidence.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Retrospectives and team feedback drive enhancements in our processes. We encourage feedback and learning in a psychologically safe environment.
